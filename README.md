## üí° About the game
Welcome to Wordle, a simple and fun word-guessing game!
Wordle is a word puzzle game that challenges you to guess a hidden five-letter word. You have six attempts to guess the correct word. After each guess, the game indicates which letters from the guess are not in the word, which are but not in the right spot, and which are in the correct spot.

A correct letter turn ${\color{green}green}$.

A correct letter in the wrong place turn ${\color{yellow}yellow}$.

An incorrect letter turn ${\color{grey}grey}$.

Letters can be used more than once.
Can you guess the word in six attempts or fewer?

Unlike the original Wordle game, there is no one word per day rule, you can play again as many times as you want.
